# Eccentric  joint analysis

This an application with user interface for calculating stress analysis on eccentric joints based on the method described in the book [*Airframe Stress Analysis*](https://github.com/b3n-b3n/eccentric_joint_analysis/blob/main/additional_info/Eccentric%20Joints.pdf) by Michael Niu

The [documentation](https://github.com/b3n-b3n/eccentric_joint_analysis/blob/main/additional_info/documentation.md) could be found in the directory additional_info.

#### Here is preview of the graphic user interface:
