(A) CALCULATION
    centroid calculation {cm:2021-06-06}
        change to the method form notes {cm:2021-06-06}
    create calculate class {cm:2021-06-07}
    transform force to vectors {cm:2021-06-11}
    
(B) INPUT INTERFACE 
    name elements in scheme {c} {cm:2021-06-03}
        add bolt name to inputs     {cm:2021-06-03}
        add entry for name in force {cm:2021-06-03}
    axis and orientation {cm:2021-06-03}
        make image of axis and positive rotation {cm:2021-06-03}
    add units to the input {cm:2021-06-03}
    remove stuff {cm:2021-06-03}
        remove E, Rm {cm:2021-06-03}
        put moment of force here {cm:2021-06-03}
    loading variables {cm:2021-06-05}
    error message for loading incorrect variables {cm:2021-06-07}
    separate the table into a different class
        get on with a numerous errors this will cause
(B) SCHEME  {c}
    resizsing {cm:2021-06-14}
        resize diameters of bolts {cm:2021-06-14}
        resize force {cm:2021-06-14}
        make a larger padding frame {cm:2021-06-05}
        check for overlaping
    axis {cm:2021-06-05}
        mark axis inside of the scheme {cm:2021-06-05}
    naming the elemets {cm:2021-06-05}
        add name to each bolt in scheme {cm:2021-06-05}
        name the centroid {cm:2021-06-05}
        add name to each force in the scheme {cm:2021-06-05}
    use exclusively input moment of force in the image
(C) GENERATING A REPORT
(D) DOCUMENTATION


do some checkups
generate csv output
take in csv file as an input
adjust the main interface so it looks somewhat nice
